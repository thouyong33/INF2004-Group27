/*
 *	smp_atomic.c
 *	RP2040 architecture primitives for SMP (Phase 4).
 *
 *	Cortex-M0+ implements ARMv6-M, which has no LDREX/STREX and therefore
 *	no compare-and-swap of any kind.  Every atomic here is built from a SIO
 *	hardware spinlock held across a read-modify-write, with local interrupts
 *	masked for the duration.
 *
 *	The consequence is structural rather than cosmetic.  On an architecture
 *	with exclusives, an atomic is a cheap primitive from which locks are
 *	built; here an atomic *is* a lock acquisition, costing a spinlock claim
 *	and an interrupt-disable window.  Code that would reasonably spam
 *	atomics on such a machine must not do so here, and the kernel lock is
 *	deliberately not built by spinning on an atomic word.
 *
 *	Interrupts must be masked while a hardware spinlock is held: an
 *	interrupt on the same core that tried to claim the same lock would
 *	deadlock against itself, since these locks are not recursive.
