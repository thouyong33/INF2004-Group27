/*
 *	ready_queue_smp.c
 *	Global ready-queue assignment.
 *
 *	The single-core kernel only ever had to name one task: the head of the
 *	highest occupied priority. An SMP scheduler must name up to TK_MAX_CORE
 *	tasks at once, without placing one task on two processors and without
 *	violating any task's affinity.
 *
 *	Policy, unchanged from the ESP32-S3 port so the two remain comparable:
 *	one global ready queue, fixed priority, FIFO within a priority, static
 *	creation-time affinity, migration permitted, and a preference for
 *	leaving a task on the processor already running it.
 *
 *	This file is policy and contains nothing architecture-specific. The
 *	only hardware-dependent parts of scheduling -- reading the current core
 *	and poking the other one -- live behind knl_current_core() and the IPI.
