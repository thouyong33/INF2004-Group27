/*
 *	smp_dispatch.c
 *	Cross-core dispatch and explicit task placement (Phase 6).
 *
 *	Phase 6 gives core 1 the dispatcher but not yet the scheduler.  A task
 *	is placed on a core explicitly, by moving it out of the ready queue and
 *	into that core's schedtsk slot under the kernel lock.  Phase 7 replaces
 *	the placement with the global ready-queue assignment; the dispatch
 *	mechanism proven here does not change.
 *
 *	Splitting it this way is deliberate.  The dispatcher and the scheduling
 *	policy fail in different ways -- the dispatcher corrupts contexts, the
 *	policy picks the wrong task -- and debugging them together on hardware
 *	means never knowing which one is wrong.
 *
 *	The invariant that matters here: a task must never be current on two
 *	cores.  Placement therefore removes the task from the ready queue, so
 *	the other core's reschedule cannot select it, and refuses outright if
 *	the other core is already running it.
