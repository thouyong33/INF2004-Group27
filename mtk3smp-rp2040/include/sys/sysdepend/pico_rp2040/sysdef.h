 * Board pin assignment
 *
 * Target board is the Raspberry Pi Pico W.  Its on-board LED is not on an
 * RP2040 pin at all: it hangs off the CYW43439 radio's own GPIO and needs the
 * full cyw43 driver to reach, so this port drives an external LED instead.
 *
 * The following RP2040 pins are wired to the CYW43439 on the Pico W and must
 * not be claimed as general-purpose I/O.  On the non-W Pico, GP25 is the LED
 * and these are free.
 *
 *	GP23	WL_ON	radio power enable (left low: radio held off)
 *	GP24	WL_D	radio SPI data
 *	GP25	WL_CS	radio chip select
 *	GP29	WL_CLK	radio SPI clock (also ADC3 / VSYS sense)
 *
 * Also already committed on this board: GP0/GP1 are the UART0 console, and
 * GP26..GP28 are the sample ADC driver's inputs when USE_SDEV_DRV is enabled.
 *
 * BOARD_LED_PIN is the external LED used as the liveness indicator.  Change
 * it to any free GPIO that has an LED attached.

 * Startup checkpoint diagnostic.
 *
 * Set BOARD_DIAG_GPIO_SCAN to 1 to flash a numbered checkpoint on
 * BOARD_DIAG_GPIO_MASK at each stage of startup, using nothing but register
 * writes and stack locals.  It works before the vector table is relocated,
 * before .data is loaded, before .bss is cleared and before any console
 * exists, which is precisely the window where no other instrumentation is
 * available.
 *
 * This located the unaligned .data load that HardFaulted every boot of the
 * stock port during baseline import.  It is retained, disabled, because
 * Phase 3 core-1 bring-up has the same problem: the second core comes up with
 * no console and no scheduler, so a GPIO checkpoint is the only signal
 * available.
 *
 * The mask covers GP2..GP22 and GP26..GP28: everything except the UART0
 * console (GP0/GP1) and the CYW43439 radio pins (GP23/24/25/29).
